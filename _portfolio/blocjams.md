short-description: Bloc Jams for iOS is a sleek and responsive personal music player.
---

The express vision behind the creation of Bloc Jams perceived a minimalistic music-player that still offered the user an energetic feel from the vibrant color palette.  The app was designed using AngularJS, so the app transitions with lightening fast responsiveness.

---

An added component that makes this application stand out is the inclusion of the versatile player bar that allows the user to continue navigation while keeping in view the current media file that is playing.  This app came alive elegantly!

In case there was any concern that this app becomes unusable when employed on a mobile device, rest assured it's fully functional :) Rock on.
