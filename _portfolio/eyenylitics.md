short-description: An Analytics service to register applications and interpret data.

Metrics. Analysis. Vision.  This is the age of data.  Not that data has ever been a hindrance to organizational operations, but quite the contrary, without data it is nearly impossible to compete in the digital age.  That's why creating a custom analytics service was such a blast!  Users create an account, and then register their website(s).  Eyenylitics gives customers greater perspective into web data in order to assist with making informed data-driven decisions.

A tiny code snippet is provided for users' web application(s) that posts analytics metrics to the user's account on Eyenylitics.  When page elements are activated by site visitors, jQuery documents those events.  The jQuery events are passed to the eyenylitics snippet that brings them home to site owners' registered applications, and BAM!  Data in hand.

How easy to use is data without a visual representation?  It's not.  That is precisely why I incorporated charts to display the data on.  The home page quickly displays the last two registered applications' data, for an at-a-glance update from a couple of differing chart types. The charts are fully interactive by simply hovering, which is a major plus as well.
