Bloc Chat.  Say what?  Exactly!  Bloc chat is a straight-forward messaging application that removes all the clutter gained from mainstream chatting applications.  Bloc Chat stands alone as a basic peer to peer communications tool, or could easily be integrated into a larger web application portfolio to add messaging as applicable.  Bloc Chat is lean, efficient, and mobile ready.
