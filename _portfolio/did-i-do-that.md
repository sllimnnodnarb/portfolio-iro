short-description: A Responsive To-Do List app. Life is busy. Make a checklist. Live well.

Developing a to-do list application was a really fun project.  Most individuals are not toting a laptop around with them while running errands and checking off their list of things to accomplish.  With that in mind, Did I Do That was designed to be fully mobile responsive; to be readily converted to an iOS or android application to be light and easy to use on the go.

The app is painlessly simple... users create to-do items, then mark them complete!

The original design for this project was to make the list 'self-destructing'.  While I understand the concept that if a to-do list item does not have a deadline, there may be no urgency to actually get the task done in a timely manner; I wanted to ensure users that in the event that they did not get a task done on time, that the task was not destructed forever.  The solution I devised was to generate a separate list in a 'user history' that compiled all the tasks that either expired in time, or that were manually marked as complete.  This way there was more grace to the user, as well as a way to recall tasks that might be recurring events but not necessarily needed to be on the list all the time.  This worked nicely not only from a UX/UI standpoint, but for practicality's sake also.

I implemented the user avatar to display a user's login image to personalize the feel of the application.  Beyond creating, deleting, updating, and storing to-do items to a user history, I wanted to additionally let a user quickly have a count of how many tasks they had active at any given time.  I displayed this subtly below the users logo on their profile page, and voila! An Easy to use to-do list app with lots of little details to provide a great user experience.  Check out this video tour of the application for a quick idea of the flow and minimalistic usability of the application. Enjoy!
