Welcome to the site!  Allow me to introduce myself.  I grew up in North Texas near [Glen Rose](http://www.glenrosetexas.net/164/Convention-Visitors-Bureau), and spent my early years exploring the Texas hill country and all of the wonders it has to offer.  If you are ever passing through the area, my three favorite eateries with a 30 minute radius are:
1. [Hard 8 BBQ](http://www.hardeightbbq.com/)
2. [Loco Coyote](http://www.lococoyotegrill.com/menu.html) 
3. [Pastafina](http://www.pastafinas.com/) 

Also, some places worth visiting in the area include:
1. [Dinosaur Valley State Park](http://tpwd.texas.gov/state-parks/dinosaur-valley)
2. [Big Rocks Park](http://trtdg.com/2010/05/12/big-rocks-park-in-glen-rose-texas/)
3. [Fossil Rim Wildlife Center](https://fossilrim.org/)

I attended college at [Tarleton State University](http://www.tarleton.edu/home/) where I earned a M.S. in Management and Leadership. With much sweat and tears I pulled off a 4.0/4.0, and lived to tell about it.  Tarleton is a school rich with tradition, and in such a great community.

After college, I married my wife Jeannette, and our family now lives near [Boerne, TX](https://visitboerne.org/).
If we aren't chasing the kids around you can find us taking a stroll outside or reading.

I have a passion for web design, and enjoy seeing ideas come to life!  More than anything I seek to serve others in my work, and gain great joy in the completion of any project that results in satisfaction.  I put great emphasis on laboring with urgency and precision, carfully weighing the scope of each task to ensure timely completion.  Take a look at some of the projects I have recently completed on the home page, and the corresonding case studies for a better perspective into the kind of work I have produced.

If you would like to get in touch you can contact me at any of the links at the top of the page, or via the form on the [contact](/contact/) page. Thanks for stopping by!
