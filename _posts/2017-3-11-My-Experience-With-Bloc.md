title: My Experience With Bloc
---

If you have read my recent post [Comfort Is Not My Calling](/2017/03/10/Comfort-Is-Not-My-Calling/), you will understand with more clarity the journey that I am on.  While I have experienced some ups and downs with Bloc, I did not begin initially with Bloc as my choice provider for learning to code.  I began with FreeCodeCamp.

Let me be clear up front, FreeCodeCamp costs $0.00(no, not even one).  Bloc will set you back the price of a technical college degree in some places.  That said, you get what you pay for.  I fully understand the heart behind FreeCodeCamp, and what it seeks to do to educate individuals who want to gain some basic understanding of how to code.  But the overall structure is lacking.  Of course, who is getting paid to build the curriculum?  No one(no, not even one).  Now there may be some advertising revenue, but that goes without saying for any website, but I want to make clear the difference between Bloc and some of the free avenues to learn to code available on the innernets.  One startling aspect about Bloc is the confidence in their ability to train lay persons to code.  Their front page makes this boast, "Computer science fundamentals with practical programming skills. Get an engineering job upon graduation or weâ€™ll refund your tuition in full."  For most programs at Bloc, the time and degree of instruction is six months to one year.  That is a tremendous amount of time to invest in training a single individual.  Of course tuition can be paid all up front or as the course progresses, but the point I am making is that to spend that kind of time and energy to train up a student to be a fully functioning web developer, and then if that person cannot get a job, to offer a full tuition reimbursement...that is serious confidence.  Either Bloc is wildly dishonest, or wildly good at what they do.  Allow me to explain.

I have been plowing through the Bloc curriculum painstakingly for exactly three months.  Let me warn you up-front, this is not for the faint of heart.  If you are the type of person who can't stick with something, or when things get difficult, you quit; don't even waste your time and effort.  Coding is very difficult.  There is a reason why entry level web developers earn $60,000.00 / year, and skilled coders earn salaries in excess of $100,000.00 /year. Coding is tremendously difficult.  Coding is volatile by nature; a single semicolon or parenthesis misplaced shuts down an entire application sometimes.  Then when you are already working with hundreds or thousands of lines of code, tracing that syntactical error down is mind numbing.  Then you put all of that on a timeline, and you feel the pressure of coding itself.  I say again, this is not for the faint of heart!  But there is great satisfaction in a job well done.

The course curriculum is very in depth at Bloc.  They take you through a number of curriculum sets for each language that you are learning, the, you are tested along the way in varying formats.  You are tested with small quizzes to see if you were listening to what was just said, then you are asked to write the code that you just learned in a manner that applies the knowledge to an application.  And at the end of some modules you are even placed in front of an interview board that conducts a mock interview; it is during this time that you feel the pressure of what an interview would be like in real life as you are asked language specific questions, and then asked to write code on the spot to fulfill user stories that would be found in actual web application scenarios.

All things considered, Bloc is an incredible training program.  I still several months to go to complete the training program, but everything is legitimate.  I am not at all regretting the financial commitment that I made to get an incredible education to facilitate and demonstrate competency as a web developer.  The mentor meetings are great for gaining further insight into the world of coding, and to have someone to help you break through difficult tasks is of exponential value.  I have enjoyed developing two applications so far, and look forward to a lifetime of coding.
