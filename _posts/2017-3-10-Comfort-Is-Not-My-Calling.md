title: Comfort Is Not My Calling
---
Let's just say comfort is not what I have ultimately been called to.  After almost a decade in an engineering role in the oil and gas industry, I came to a fork.  I'm not talking repositories either.  

In all seriousness, my wife and I had done a decent job juggling life, managing finances, setting goals up like dominoes, and then knocking them down with ease.  We had it all planned out, work as field engineer for another twenty to thirty years, and retire with a comfortable nest-egg, and proceed about the business of whatever we desired to do.

Of course, as life generally goes, so goes the plans of a man.  There arose a great deal of relational strains, and my wife and I found ourselves missing out on the most important matters of life.  We were searching for some other avenue to regain the lost opportunities that we were missing, and resolved that I should learn to code.  The market demand is significant for quality developers, and the entirety of my 'grown-up' career had been in working with various software platforms required to conduct well-site engineering operations, so learning to code seemed to be a fit.

Stepping into the depths of coding is intimidating, and there seems to be an endless sea of information to consume.  What do I learn, where do I go from here?  How do I apply what I have learned?  What information is reliable?  All of these questions were swirling inside my mind, and it can be dizzying. I did a great deal of research and decided to learn from Bloc.  They are the leading institution in terms of providing the technical know-how that prospective web designers and developers must have in order to succeed.  So I signed up.

Nevertheless, the comfortable thing to do would be to stay the course, but as I found out, and as I am still presently finding out, comfort is not my calling.You see, doing what is uncomfortable takes courage.  You cannot be timid or passive to embark on a new path in life.  And here I am, blazing this trail.  So far, I have learned HTML, CSS3, Javascript, jQuery, Git, AngularJS, and how to interact with a few third party providers like BuzzLibrary and Firebase.

I have a natural bent for creativity, and also lean heavily toward the type-A personality realm.  It is an unusual combination to be compulsively organized and orderly, but yet have the ability to vividly envision the way a project might come to be, or to make analogous one thing to another so that the options for development of an idea are pushed to the extremities.  I am excited to continue to have more and more opportunities to put these personal gifts to use through web design and development.  

Comfort is boring.  So I decided to learn to code.
