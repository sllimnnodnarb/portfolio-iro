title: Front-End Development
---

Front-end development, at the core, represents a term that describes the design, layout, and functionality of a web application.  Specifically front-end web development handles the arrangement of block elements on the web page, the styling and formatting of those elements, and the functionality given to those elements.  

---
Some of the languages I have used for effective front-end development include HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, and AngularJS.  Today, I will give a short overview of each of HTML and CSS and the role they play in front-end development and design.

HTML, or hyper-text markup language, is a coding language that it universally recognized by web browsers.  This language serves to specify individual components that when combined, render complete a web page.  The most basic HTML file is usually the index.html file.  The index.html file contains the critical <script></script> tags that allow javascript to run, third party services to be contained, and much more.  The index file also lays out the structure of the web page.  Web pages begin at the top with an identifier know as <!DOCTYPE html>.  This alerts the web browser right away that it is an HTML document.  The next element on the web page is <html></html>.  This tag contains all of the other sub-elements on the web page.  HTML web pages load top to bottom so the order that the elements are included matters a great deal.  One should be careful to not include a n element that depends on a particular third-party script to load properly before actually including the script in advance earlier in the HTML file.  HTML is the way elements are included in a web page, but what about their appearance?

Introducing CSS.  CSS, or cascading style sheets is the way HTML elements are given stylistic elements, such as color, shape, alignment, and size.  When I was a kid, my English teacher used to use a machine called an overhead projector.  On this overhead projector she used clear plastic sheets called transparencies.  She would have a plain piece of white paper with examples of sentences on it to be diagrammed.  She would then lay the clear transparency sheet over the printed sentence diagramming paper and she would use special wet erase markers to give the appearance that particular elements of grammar that she wanted to focus on were marked up and styled to give them emphasis.  CSS is exactly like that, only instead of there being a single transparency laid atop the HTML elements, there could be an infinite amount of CSS style sheets laid on top to give different visual effects to the HTML elements.  Of course, the law of diminishing returns begins to factor in with each new CSS layer, but perhaps you can get a picture of the nature of the way CSS functions.

HTML and CSS are two powerful tools that when used properly can create beautifully rendered web pages.  Of course the functionality of the page is very limited.  That is where javascript, jQuery, AngularJS, and other languages come in to provide more functionality.  For a person seeking to learn about web design and development, HTML and CSS are great places to start learning to code.  A great free resource for anyone interested is [w3schools.com](http://www.w3schools.com).  Here you can learn how the code is composed, see examples, learn thousands of properties, and even use an editor program to try your hand at reproducing the examples given.
