title: The Bloc Jams Case Study
---
Bloc Jams was developed with the autonomous user in mind.  The idea of a no-strings-attached music player garners intrigue.  There is no account creation, and no syncing;  just transfer the files you want, and then jam out <i>ad infinitum</i>.

This case study intends to offer some depth of insight as to how Bloc Jams was developed, as well as to point to the primary user interface controls that make this application so easy to use.  The issues that were encountered during development, and the solutions that overcame those issues are displayed here.  Scroll on to learn more.

As seen above, the landing page for Bloc Jams sought to capture a range of feelings for the user.  The color palette is vibrant, yet not too loud.  The overall navigation is minimalistic, but sufficient for the requirements of a music player application that handles well.

The stylized elements of the page were set in such a way as to provide contrast, and also communicate activity when activated.  Notice in the following image the style integration of the actively engaged web-page elements.  As the user navigates to the 'Albums' page, the page styling responds appropriately.

Again, as shown below, when the user intends to navigate to the 'Choose your music' page, the stylized elements of the page respond and flow seamlessly.

One objective of the Bloc Jams application was to populate the song-list from an album; as seen here.

A problem that arose was the need to manage the activity of the song actively playing as the user navigated between pages of the application.  The solution was to include a player-bar at the bottom of each page.  It is also worth noting the consistency of stylized control elements that nicely tie together the color schematic of this application.

As much as 90% of site traffic now comes from mobile devices, and that number does not look to be decreasing anytime in the foreseeable future.  With this in consideration, significant emphasis was given to the flexibility and response of Bloc Jams to the most common mobile screen sizes that the application would most prevalently be rendered on.  The result of this foresight produced a responsive application that in no way sacrifices usability for presentation.

The completion of the Bloc Jams application marked the availability of a music player application that displays song-lists, plays, pauses, navigates song indices, and is accessible across all application views.  Bloc Jams brings together the desired elements of a personal music player with continuity of style and design.
