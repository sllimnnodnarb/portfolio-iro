As the title suggests, this page is a quick glimpse into some of my educational accomplishments.  I mention on my [about](/about/) page that I went to college at [Tarleton State University](http://www.tarleton.edu/home/) where I earned a M.S. in Management and Leadership. With much sweat and tears I pulled off a 4.0/4.0, and lived to tell about it.  The GPA is listed at the bottom of the transcript on page 3.

The last 7 years of my oil and gas career was spent doing automated directional drilling.  I was selected to be the primary research and development field engineer.  I spent many years assisting in the testing and analysis of proprietary software for automation.  After that, I decided to take what I knew about logical software operations, and put those analytical skills to use as web developer. I enrolled in Bloc, the leading institution for training up next-generation web developers.  At Bloc I learned html, css, javascript, jQuery, Git, AngularJS, Ruby on Rails, Markdown (what this current app is built largely using), and PostgreSQL. Here is my Web Developer certificate from Bloc.
